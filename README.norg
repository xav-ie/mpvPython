Trying to get playlists working in nixos

** Problem

I want to enqueue multiple files and later do other cool things with python and mpv

** Todo

- [ ] get core playlist functionality
- [ ] flakify
- [ ] make MPV read from main config... does not run mpv from main config but has its own?

** Running 
   `nix-shell`

** Alternative
   https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/issues/8405
   Use socat with mpv... Easier for short term, but I think that having python bindings is useful.
